# Donors and Donations for ALSETLab

Donating towards our research and education activities is an investment to the future generations of engineers and researchers that are trained and educated @ALSETLab, and to foster continued growth in engineering.

Carrying out research is costly, research funds are normally gathered through funding from grant applications which mostly cover the researchers salaries and tuition, and some other things like going to conferences and publishing papers. The normal cycle of obtaining funding is long and uncertain, which makes it difficult to carry out long term projects such as those you can see in our [Github](https://alsetlab.github.io/software/) repositories.

Below, is a list of our generous donors, contributing to the development of our real-time hardware-in-the loop simulation platform for experimental testing, and our other research & education activities.

We welcome any donations in the form of products, software licenses, services, lab equipment, cash or your time. See the examples below if you need some ideas of how to help!

To donate, please get in touch directly with me <luigi.vanfretti@gmail.com>; or if you prefer to do an anonymous donation please send a check or money order to the [ECSE department chair with a letter indicating that you want to contribute to ALSETLab and ALSETLab's efforts](https://ecse.rpi.edu/index.php/mike-wozny).

- [Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories]() has made a substantial donation equipment and engineering time to set up a specialized rack for substation automation and synchrophasor applications. We would like to thank SEL in general, and in particular, to Dr. [Greg Zweigle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-zweigle-4211b064/) and Miss [Jennifer White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferawhite/) for making this donation possible.
  - Note: Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories has been extremely generous with me (Luigi) since 2011 when I developed the now defunct SmarTS Lab. They have previously donated equipment, software and their time, which was a contribution towards my previous research... we still have and use all of it for our work! This company is a great example of American generosity! Thank you!!!

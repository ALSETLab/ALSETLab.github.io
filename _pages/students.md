#### Study for the tests! Really!
RPI has the score requirements above for our graduate program in Electrical Engineering. It is very difficult (not to say impossible) to admit a student for graduate studies if the scores are not met, specially the GRE/Quantitative score.

Also, you should be aware that many other students will be applying, and good GRE scores is an easy way of differentiating yourself from other applicants.

Before you do anything, ***and specially before taking the tests***, you should prepare very well to attain the marks suggested above.
Here's what you can do to prepare:
1. Take a course: [here](https://gre.magoosh.com/online-prep) or [here](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/).
2. Prepare using a practice book or website: [here](https://www.kaptest.com/gre/gre-practice/free-gre-practice-questions-workout) is a free one.
3. Repeat steps 1. and 2. above.

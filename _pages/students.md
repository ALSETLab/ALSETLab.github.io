# Prospective Students
#### News - Fall 2017!:
  * I am looking for MSc/PhD students to join ALSETLab @RPI for Spring and Fall 2018.
  * Positions for 4 students, funded by the ECSE department.
  * I'm looking for students with:
    - (a) a strong background on mathematics and physics, control systems theory, digital signal processing, numerical methods, numerical computing, computer engineering or computer science, with interest in modeling and simulation of cyber-physical systems and/or systems engineering. ***You will work on the development of applied system identification methods for power system model validation.***
    - OR
    - (b) background with embedded systems, digital signal processing, experience physical laboratory set-up in electrical engineering, experience with substation automation equipment, and interested in the development of experimental platforms for IoT in the area of electrical power. ***You will work on the development of a time-sensitive experimental platform and design of experiments for synchrophasor applications.***
  * Students should have experience with with experience with the Modelica language and Modelica tools (OM, Dymola, JModelica ...), Python, MATLAB/Simulink, C++ (GNU + Visual Studio), LabVIEW and the cRIO, GIT, PSS/E, Real-Time Simulation, etc.
  * Brownie points if you have a Github repository, double brownie points if you contribute to a project, triple if you have your own on Github.
  * More information to come...

### Do you want to work in my team (ALSETLab)?
To work in my team you have to be formally admitted for graduate studies at RPI. * It is not necessary to contact me prior to application, just indicate that you want to work with me in your documentation once you have fulfilled the requirements for admission.*

### RPI's Admission Requirements
#### List of Requirements
- Visit RPI's Grad. Admission website to find out about the requirements [here](http://admissions.rpi.edu/graduate/admission/).
- Check if you are in one of the Embargoed and Sanctioned Countries [here](http://admissions.rpi.edu/graduate/admission/index.html#Anchor-International-49575), if you are, please contact admissions office before applying, [here](http://admissions.rpi.edu/graduate/contact/index.html).
#### Test Scores
- TOEFL score of 230 CBT/88 iBT/570 PBT (IELTS 6.5 or PTE 60)
- GRE Scores:
  - ***Category 1.*** Verbal: 156, Quantitative: 146, Analytical: 4.0
  - ***Category 2.*** Verbal: 149, Quantitative: 155, Analytical: 3.5

#### Study for the tests! Really!
RPI has the score requirements above for our graduate program in Electrical Engineering. It is very difficult (not to say impossible) to admit a student for graduate studies if the scores are not met, specially the GRE/Quantitative score.

Also, you should be aware that many other students will be applying, and good GRE scores is an easy way of differentiating yourself from other applicants.

Before you do anything, ***and specially before taking the tests***, you should prepare very well to attain the marks suggested above.
Here's what you can do to prepare:
1. Take a course: [here](https://gre.magoosh.com/online-prep) or [here](https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/).
2. Prepare using a practice book or website: [here](https://www.kaptest.com/gre/gre-practice/free-gre-practice-questions-workout) is a free one.
3. Repeat steps 1. and 2. above.

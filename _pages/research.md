# Research Projects
## On-going Research  

- ALSETLab: a time-sensitive and real-time simulabion-based hardware & software development and testing platform for cyber-physical power systems.
    - Members: Dr. Hossein Hooshyar, Prottay Adhikari.
    - Funded by the ECSE department of RPI through my faculty start-up fund.
    - Dr. Hossein Hooshyar is Funded by the [CURENT ERC](http://curent.utk.edu/)
    - Contact me to donate equipment, or to support this project further!


- Mission critical, time-sensitive and real-time synchrophasor technologies for distribution networks.
  - Members: Prottay Adhikari, Dr. Hossein Hooshyar.
  - Funded by the ECSE department of RPI through my faculty start-up fund.
  - Dr. Hossein Hooshyar is Funded by the [CURENT ERC](http://curent.utk.edu/).
  - Contact me to support this project!
  - *Synopsis:* This project is a continuation of work started in 2011 to develop of methods and tools for synchrophasor applications, now evolving to have a bigger focus on power distribution networks and microgrids. Some of the results of this long term effort are:
     - The [S3DK](https://github.com/ALSETLab/S3DK-STRONGgrid) a LabView toolbox for real-time PMU application prototyping.
     - The [Strongrid DLL](https://github.com/ALSETLab/S3DK-STRONGgrid), a real-time PMU data mediation library with several future functionalities in mind, such as a time-synchronization layer and multithreading - and LabView API!
     - A benchmark open source model of transmission and distribution systems for [off-line and real-time simulation](https://github.com/ALSETLab/ADN-RT-EMTP-Model).
     - ... and [many others](https://github.com/ALSETLab).


- The [OpenIPSL.org](http://openipsl.org) project works in the development of a Modelica library for power system dynamic modeling and simulation. It is the bases for my work on cyber-physical power system design and analysis methods. This project is a continuation of work started in 2012 in the use of the Modelica language for power systems.
  - See [OpenIPSL.org](http://openipsl.org) for members, results and documentation.
  - Currently un-funded. Contact me to support this project!


- System Identification for Cyber-Physical Power System Model Validation and Calibration.
  - This project deals with the development of methods and prototype implementation of tools for automated power system model identification problems with a theoretical founding on system identification methods. The [RaPId](https://github.com/alSETLab/rapid) tool is used as a platform for method implementation.
  - Currently un-funded. Contact me to support this project!


- Cyber-physical power system modeling and simulation.
  - System engineering modeling and simulation methods and tooling, e.g. [CIM/UML and Modelica](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8231176/).
  - Multi-domain modeling and simulation, power systems and other domains, e.g. joint modeling of gas turbines (thermo-mechanical models) and power systems.
  - Code generation for real-time simulation and embedded systems.
  - Currently un-funded. Contact me to support this project!  


## Past Research - Major Funded Projects

Below, I list only the most relevant and large projects that I've carried out in the past, in order of relevance (the ones that I liked the most are first).

Contact me for further information regarding smaller past projects.

The Top Three Past Projects:
- [opencps.eu](https://opencps.eu): Open Cyber-Physical System Model-Driven Certified Development. With tool interoperability, vendor lock-ins and tool life-cycle support as major challenges, this research project focuses on interoperability between the Modelica/Unified Modeling Language (UML)/Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standards, improved (co-)simulation execution speed, and verified code generation.
- The [FP7 IDE4L project](http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/196576_en.html) project developed a substation automation architecture, and we contributed with a synchrophasor protocol gateway and PMU for distribution networks.
- The [FP7 iTesla](http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/101320_en.html) project developed a dynamic security assessment software platform, mostly used in France.

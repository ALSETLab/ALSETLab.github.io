Here are some links to publications, organizations, institutions, projects and people; this is not intended as a commercial endorsement of any kind.

Some of the above I work with, contribute to, or use in my research.

# Where to publish?
These is my shortlist of the journals that I think are relevant. I only list Open Access journals where I have published with colleagues, and/or where I have evidence of unbiased quality peer review process.

- Data in Brief: [link](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/data-in-brief)
- MethodsX: [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/22150161)
- IEEE Access: [link](http://ieeeaccess.ieee.org)

# Where to find good researchers and their teams in my research areas?
This is a list of collaborators and/or people I admire... incomplete, and in no particular order.

### The Sys. Id. Crowd
- [Prof. Xavier Bombois, École Centrale Lyon, France](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en/contacts/xavier-bombois), works on System Identification and is also CNRS Research Director with Laboratoire Ampere.

### The Modelica Crowd
- [Prof. Peter Fritzon, Linköping Univ., Sweden](http://www.ida.liu.se/~petfr27/) leading the [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org) effort.
- [Prof. Francesco Casella, Polimi, Italy](http://home.deib.polimi.it/casella/index.html), developer of the [ThermoPower](https://github.com/casella/ThermoPower) Modelica library and many other [cool things](https://github.com/casella).

# Where to get a PMU? - Build one! OpenPMU Project
- I have tried helping a bit my friend [Dr. David Laverty](http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/EPIC/Profile/?name=david.laverty) in his great effort developing and open source software/hardware PMU device and ecosystem which you can find [here](https://sites.google.com/site/openpmu/).

- The "legacy" OpenPMU version 1 is being documented and maintained at ALSETLab, [here](https://alsetlab.github.io/S3DK/docs/Code_Flow_Chart.html).

# What tools you use in your research that are not made by yourself?
## Modelica and the FMI Standard
- [Modelica Association](https://www.modelica.org): developing the Modelica language standard and FMI standard.
- [FMI Website](http://fmi-standard.org): providing info on the FMI standard.

- [jModelica](http://jmodelica.org):extensible Modelica-based open source platform for optimization, simulation and analysis of complex dynamic systems.
- [Modelon's](http://www.modelon.com) tools and libraries rock!
- [Papyrus](https://eclipse.org/papyrus-rt/): Papyrus-RT provides an implementation of the UML-RT modeling language together with editors, code generator for C++ and a supporting runtime system and model-compare (diff/merge) capabilities.
- [LBL's Simulation Research Group Tools at GitHub](http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov) and [GitHub Account]
(https://github.com/lbl-srg): The Simulation Research Group specializes in the research, development and deployment of software that support the design and operation of buildings, as well as the research of next-generation building energy and control systems.
- [Python Migration](http://bci2000.org/downloads/BCPy2000/Migration.html): list of tips and resources for migrating from Matlab to Python-based systems using NumPy and SciPy.
- [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/what-is-anaconda): environment for Python and R that includes several pre-installed libraries and tools (e.g. Spyder and Jupyter).
- [MPCPy](https://github.com/lbl-srg/MPCPy) python-based open-source platform for model predictive control in buildings.


## System Identification Tools
- [RaPId Toolbox](https://github.com/ALSETLab/RaPId), MATLAB-based (unfortunately) - this one we made with my students...
- [DSI Toolbox](https://github.com/ftuffner/DSIToolbox) MATLAB-based (unfortunately).

# Links to Modeling Languages and Tools
## Modelica and the FMI Standard
- [Modelica Association](https://www.modelica.org): developing the Modelica language standard and FMI standard.
- [FMI Website](http://fmi-standard.org): providing info on the FMI standard.
- [OpenModelica](https://www.openmodelica.org): Open Source Modelica Consortium and the OSS OpenModelica environment.
- [jModelica](http://jmodelica.org):extensible Modelica-based open source platform for optimization, simulation and analysis of complex dynamic systems.
- [Papyrus](https://eclipse.org/papyrus-rt/): Papyrus-RT provides an implementation of the UML-RT modeling language together with editors, code generator for C++ and a supporting runtime system and model-compare (diff/merge) capabilities.

## Modelica Learning Resources
- [modelica.university](http://modelica.university/res/apps): Interactive web-based Modelica models and simulation showcases. ** See ** the ``Tour of Modelica``.

## Modelica Tools-and-chains
- [Modelica in Action](https://github.com/mbonvini/ModelicaInAction)  create, compile and simulate Modelica models using JModelica.org.

## System Identification Tools
# See also the RaPId Toolbox! (https://github.com/ALSETLab/RaPId)[https://github.com/ALSETLab/RaPId]
- [DSI Toolbox](https://github.com/ftuffner/DSIToolbox)
- [CONTSID Toolbox](http://www.contsid.cran.univ-lorraine.fr)

# Bookmarks
Here are some links/bookmarks to resources I have used or use routinely for my research.

## Research Software resources
- [LBL's Simulation Research Group Tools at GitHub](http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov) and [GitHub Account]
(https://github.com/lbl-srg): The Simulation Research Group specializes in the research, development and deployment of software that support the design and operation of buildings, as well as the research of next-generation building energy and control systems.

## Useful Python Links
- [Python Migration](http://bci2000.org/downloads/BCPy2000/Migration.html): list of tips and resources for migrating from Matlab to Python-based systems using NumPy and SciPy.
- [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/what-is-anaconda): environment for Python and R that includes several pre-installed libraries and tools (e.g. Spyder and Jupyter).
- [MPCPy](https://github.com/lbl-srg/MPCPy) python-based open-source platform for model predictive control in buildings.

### About this Website
This is the website of Prof. Luigi Vanfretti and ALSETLab, his research group and laboratory at the department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY.
This website is under construction, more information will be uploaded shortly. In the mean time, you can take a look at the software repositories available in Github:
- [ALSETLab on Github!](https://github.com/ALSETLab): All code repositories related to Luigi's work, except OpenIPSL.
- [OpenIPSL](http://openipsl.org): The OpenIPSL.org project with our Modelica library for power system simulation.

### A short bio
![luigixsmall](https://alsetlab.github.io/images/luigi_small.jpg "Small Picture")
Luigi Vanfretti (SMIEEE'14) obtained the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electric power engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.
He was with KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, as Assistant 2010-2013), and Associate Professor (Tenured) and Docent (2013-2017/August); where he lead the SmarTS Lab and research group. He also worked at Statnett SF, the Norwegian electric power transmission system operator, as consultant (2011 - 2012), and Special Advisor in R&D (2013 - 2016).

He joined Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in August 2017, to continue to develop his research at ALSETLab.
His research interests are in the area of synchrophasor technology applications; and cyber-physical power system modeling, simulation, stability and control.

### About ALSETLab
ALSETLab is the name of Luigi's research group and also the real-time hardware-in-the-loop laboratory being built at RPI. The acronym stands for (ALSET: Analysis Laboratory for Synchrophasor and Electrical energy Technology) and (Lab: for Lab).
> Note: although the acronym is more of an excuse for using the name of Nikola Tesla somehow, read ALSET backwards!

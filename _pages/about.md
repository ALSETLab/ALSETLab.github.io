### About ALSETLab
ALSETLab is the name of Luigi's research group and also the real-time hardware-in-the-loop laboratory facility built for research at RPI. The acronym stands for (ALSET: Analysis Laboratory for Synchrophasor and Electrical energy Technology) and (Lab: for Laboratory). Click on "The Lab!" in the navigation bar to see what "The Lab!" is all about.

``Note: although the acronym is more of an excuse for using the name of Nikola Tesla... read ALSET backwards!``

### About Luigi Vanfretti

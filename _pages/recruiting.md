### ***2024-12-12:*** Notice to Prospective Researchers and Students
I will NOT be recruiting any graduate students (MSc and PhD) to join my team for the foreseeable future.

I have been on sabbatical from August 2023 to August 2024 and, unfortunately, I have not managed to obtain any new research grants (in other words, many grant applications have been rejected :-( ). Consequently, I will NOT be looking for any new students in the near future. 
My current priority is to find funds to support my existing group of students, however, if funding becomes available, I may start looking for new students to join in Fall 2026.

Please do not email me with requests and questions about joining my research program because I will not have available funding to support additional students. 
See more information about how funding/support schemes for  [here](https://alsetlab.github.io/students/).

# Available Positions

* **Undergrads:** I am currently not taking in any additional undergraduates to work with my team. I will start taking new undergrads in Fall 2026.

* **Post-docs and Senior Researchers:** no positions available available in the foreseeable future.

* **What am I looking for in a new students/researchers?** I am looking for students interested in modeling and simulation of grid-to-X systems and measurement data analytics. You ***MUST*** have at least MSc in the area of electrical engineering, with a concentration in power engineering, in order to be considered.

My priority is to work with Modelica, FMI and associated technologies, I will favor those with proven experience and work in those areas.

My second interest is on measurement data analytics, I will favor those with proven experience and work on real-world data from synchrophasor measurements, digital fault recorders, etc., while applying spectral analysis methods. 

Before contacting me, please apply to RPI for admission into the graduate program. There is nothing I can offer until you have passed through the whole admissions process.

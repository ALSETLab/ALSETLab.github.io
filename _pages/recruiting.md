Available Positions:
- I am looking for PhD students to start either on Spring 2023 or Fall 2023 on modeling and simulation of grid-to-X systems and measurement data analytics.

* **Visitors:** get in touch with me personally, at luigi dot vanfretti at gmail dot com. You are welcome to visit for a period of at least one semester (if you hold a PhD) or one year (if you do not have a PhD), and under your own funding. I do not have funds to support your visit. **IMPORTANT:** Check if you are in one of the Embargoed and Sanctioned Countries [here](http://admissions.rpi.edu/graduate/admission/index.html#Anchor-International-49575), if you are, please contact admissions office before applying, [here](http://admissions.rpi.edu/graduate/contact/index.html). **Note:** As a national research institution in the United States, Rensselaerâ€™s activities are subject to restrictions by the U.S. government, including export-related restrictions. **This makes it increasingly difficult for the Institute to accept students or visitors who are nationals of embargoed countries.** Unfortunately, if you are from of those embargoed countries, it is unlikely that RPI will allow me to receive you as a visitor.

* **Post-docs:** no positions available.

* **Undergrads:** if you are an undergrad at RPI and you want to work with me doing research, just get in touch with me personally to book a meeting! Send an email to: luigi dot vanfretti at gmail dot com

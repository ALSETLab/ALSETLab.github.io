### ***2025-10-04:*** Notice to Prospective Researchers and Students - I will NOT be recruiting any graduate students (MSc and PhD) to join my team for the foreseeable future.

Given the uncertain funding situation in the United States due to budget cuts in different agencies, and because I have not managed to obtain any new research grants (many grant applications have been rejected), I will NOT be looking for any new students in the near future. 

My current priority is to find funds to support my existing group of students, however, in the unlikely event that more funding than expected becomes available, I may start looking for new students to join in Fall 2027.

Please do not email me with requests and questions about joining my research program because I will not have available funding to support additional students. 

See more information about how funding/support schemes for  [here](https://alsetlab.github.io/students/).

# Available Positions: None

* **Undergrads:** I am currently not taking in any additional undergraduates to work with my team. I will start taking new undergrads in Fall 2027.

* ***MSc Students:*** I don't foresee taking any MSc students in the future unless they are self-supported or have a fellowship.

* ***PhD Students:*** I am currently not taking in any PhD students. I don't foresee taking any PhD students until Fall 2027, unless they are self-supported or have a fellowship.

* **Post-docs and Senior Researchers:** no positions available available in the foreseeable future.


## What am I looking for in a new students/researchers?

I am looking for students interested in modeling and simulation of grid-to-X systems and measurement data analytics. 

You ***MUST*** have at least MSc in the area of electrical or energy engineering. Ideally, you will have with a concentration in electrical power or previous experience with power grids or power electronics.

My priority is to work advancing modeling and simulation technologies that adopt Open Access Standards and help their industrial adoption. In particular, I'd be interested if you have experience Modelica, the FMI, eFMI and other associated technologies; I will favor those with proven experience and work in those technologies.

My second interest is on measurement data analytics, I will favor those with proven experience and work on real-world data from synchrophasor measurements, digital fault recorders, etc., while applying spectral analysis methods. 

Before contacting me, please apply to [RPI for admission into the graduate program](https://gradadmissions.rpi.edu/). There is nothing I can offer until you have passed through the whole admissions process.

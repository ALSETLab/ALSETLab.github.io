### ***2023-02-21:*** Notice to Prospective Researchers and Students
I will be on sabbatical leave during Fall 2023 and Spring 2024. Therefore, I will NOT be recruiting any students to join my team during that period. The earliest that I will be looking for students to join my team will be to join during Fall 2024.

Please do not email me with requests and questions about joining my research program, because I will not be at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute during that period.

# Available Positions

* **Undergrads:** I am currently not taking in any additional undergraduates to work with my team. I will start taking new undergrads in Fall 2025.

* ***MSc Students:*** I don't foresee taking any MSc students in the future unless they are self-supported or have a fellowship.

* ***PhD Students:*** I am currently not taking in any PhD students. I don't foresee taking any PhD students until Spirng or Fall 2025.

* **Post-docs and Senior Researchers:** no positions available available in the foreseable future.

* **What am I looking for in a new students/researchers?** I am looking for students interested in modeling and simulation of grid-to-X systems and measurement data analytics. You ***MUST*** have at least MSc in the area of electrical engineering, with a concentration in power engineering, in order to be considered.

My priority is to work with Modelica, FMI and associated technologies, I will favor those with proven experience and work in those areas.

My second interest is on measurement data analytics, I will favor those with proven experience and work on real-world data from synchrophasor measurements, digital fault recorders, etc., while applying spectral analysis methods. 

Before contacting me, please apply to RPI for admission into the graduate program. There is nothing I can offer until you have passed through the whole admissions process.

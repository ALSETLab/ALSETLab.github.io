* ***Visitors:*** get in touch with me personally, at luigi dot vanfretti at gmail dot com. You are welcome to visit for a period of at least one semester (if you hold a PhD) or one year (if you do not have a PhD), and under your own funding. I do not have funds to support your visit. **IMPORTANT:** Check if you are in one of the Embargoed and Sanctioned Countries [here](http://admissions.rpi.edu/graduate/admission/index.html#Anchor-International-49575), if you are, please contact admissions office before applying, [here](http://admissions.rpi.edu/graduate/contact/index.html). ***Note:*** As a national research institution in the United States, Rensselaerâ€™s activities are subject to restrictions by the U.S. government, including export-related restrictions. ***This makes it increasingly difficult for the Institute to accept students or visitors who are nationals of embargoed countries.*** Unfortunately, if you are from of those embargoed countries, it is unlikely that RPI will allow me to receive you as a visitor.

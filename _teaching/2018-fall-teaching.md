- Course Description:
> This course develops a solid basis for students to model and simulate cyber-physical systems using computer-based object-oriented equation-based modeling languages and tools with the goal of building models with high reusability. The course covers both theoretical and practical issues related to numerical simulation methods for CPS, including continuous time, discontinuous/discrete and timed clocked systems. Aspects of code-generation and real-time simulation for embedded systems are introduced. These foundations allow for the modeling and simulation of embedded systems which will be carried out “virtually” (by simulation) and physically using the Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

- Course Goals/Objectives:
> Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon, the seamless integration of computation and physical components. Advances in CPS will enable capability, adaptability, scalability, resiliency, safety, security, and usability that will expand the horizons of these critical systems. CPS technologies are transforming the way people interact with engineered systems, just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. New, smart CPS drive innovation and competition in a range of application domains including aeronautics, building design, energy, electrical power grids, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation, to name a few.

> In this course students will develop and master a toolset of theory, methods, computer languages and software tools for modeling and simulating cyber-physical systems. Utilizing these skills, the students will be able to architect, model, design, simulate and analyze dynamic characteristics of cyber-physical systems that are critical for society and have the possibility to transform the way humans interact with engineered systems.
